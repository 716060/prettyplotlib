prettyplotlib
=============

Python matplotlib-enhancer library which gives beautiful default plots without much work. Inspired by Edward Tufte's work on information design (http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/) and Cynthia Brewer's work on color perception (http://www.personal.psu.edu/cab38/ and http://colorbrewer2.org/).
